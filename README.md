# Dotfiles

Repository containing a few of my personal configuration files.

## Description

### Applications

- **[neovim](https://neovim.io)**, a highly configurable text editor I use for
  most programming and system administration work.

- **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)**, short for 'terminal multiplexer'
  provides things like multiple windows, sessions and panes inside the terminal.

- **[zsh](https://www.zsh.org)**, an alternative to bash that has a nice
  ecosystem for plugins.

### Installation

I recommend not trying to install this through the script yourself, as I change
this frequently depending on which machines I have in use. It's better to take a
look at the individual configuration files and copy paste configuration
directives that you think are interesting. That way, you also learn what each command
does. This is far more valuable than having a fully configured piece of software
for _someone else's_ needs, and not yours.
